#Bubble Game
Welcome to the Bubble Game! This web-based game is a fun and challenging way to test your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. In this game, you will need to pop bubbles to earn points within a 60-second time limit. Make sure you aim accurately because hitting the wrong bubble will reset your score to zero.

#How to Play
Game Objective: The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible within a 60-second time limit.

Timer: The game has a built-in timer set to 60 seconds. You must score as many points as you can before the timer runs out.

Score: Your current score is displayed on the screen throughout the game. Your initial score is 0, and you can increase it by hitting the correct bubbles.

Hit Value: Each bubble on the screen has a specific value. Your current "Hit Value" will be shown on the screen as well.

Hitting Bubbles: To increase your score, click on bubbles that have a "Hit Value" equal to your current "Hit Value." When you hit the correct bubble, your score will be incremented by 10 points.

Missing a Bubble: If you click on a bubble with a different "Hit Value" or miss the bubble entirely, your score will reset to zero. You'll need to start over and play the game again.

Winning: Try to get the highest score possible within the 60-second time limit. Compete with friends and see who can achieve the highest score!

#Note: Have fun playing the Bubble Game and aim for the high score! Good luck!
